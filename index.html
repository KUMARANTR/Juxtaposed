						<p><b>Annabelle Comes Home</b><em> is a 2019 American supernatural horror film directed by Gary Dauberman, in his directorial debut, from a script by Dauberman and a story by Dauberman and James Wan, who also acted as producer with Peter Safran. It serves as a sequel to 2014's Annabelle and 2017's Annabelle: Creation, and as the seventh installment in the Conjuring Universe franchise. The film stars Mckenna Grace, Madison Iseman, and Katie Sarife, along with Patrick Wilson and Vera Farmiga, who reprise their roles as Ed and Lorraine Warren.

In early April 2018, Warner Bros. announced that a then-untitled film in the Conjuring Universe franchise would be released on July 3, 2019. Later that month, it was announced that the film would be another installment in the Annabelle series, with Dauberman signed on to write and direct the film in his directorial debut, based on a story treatment written by Dauberman and Wan. Principal photography commenced by mid-October and officially wrapped in December 2018 in Los Angeles.

Annabelle Comes Home was theatrically released in the United States on June 26, 2019. It grossed over $231 million worldwide and received mixed reviews from critics, who found it less frightening than some of its predecessors.</em></p>
						
						<p><em><b>Demonologists Ed and Lorraine Warren</b> confiscate the Annabelle doll from nurses Debbie and Camilla, who claim that the doll often performed violent activities in their apartment. During the drive back home, the doll summons spirits to attack Ed, but he narrowly survives. Annabelle is locked in a sacred glass case in the couple's artifacts room that is blessed by Father Gordon to ensure the evil is contained.

Sometime later, the Warrens welcome Mary Ellen, who will be in charge of babysitting their daughter, Judy, at the house while they travel overnight to investigate another case. At school, Judy notices the spirit of a priest that begins following her. Mary Ellen's friend Daniela arrives uninvited to the Warrens' home, who is secretly curious about speaking to the dead. She sneaks into the artifacts room and starts examining them, ultimately trying to contact her late father. She abruptly leaves Annabelle's glass case unlocked, and the terror begins shortly afterward with the spirit of Annabelle "Bee" Mullins unleashed. That night, Annabelle begins releasing other spirits, such as the Ferryman, the Bride, a Feeley Meeley board game, and the Black Shuck.

Mary Ellen's crush Bob Palmeri arrives outside and serenades her, but is later attacked by the Black Shuck and hides in the Warrens' backyard. Mary Ellen is tormented by the Ferryman, while Judy is confronted by Annabelle in her bedroom. Daniela had left earlier but sneaks back to return the artifacts room's keys. She gets locked inside the room and tormented by various objects, such as a piano and an old television that can predict the near future. She finds the Mourner's Bracelet and sees her father twisted into a malevolent spirit. A bloody and screaming Daniela appears on the television screen after having answered a cursed telephone. The real Daniela later unwittingly reaches to answer the telephone but is interrupted by Judy and Mary Ellen.

Judy explains that they must lock Annabelle in her case again so the other spirits will rest. Bob protects Judy from the Black Shuck as she retrieves Mary Ellen's asthma inhaler, while Daniela is attacked and possessed by the Bride. Eventually, Mary Ellen and Judy find the doll when the priest's spirit, acting as Judy's guardian, guides them to the Ferryman. They manage to retrieve the glass case's key after they are attacked by demonic hands from the Feeley Meeley board game, and a possessed Daniela, but struggle to secure the case as the demon of the doll physically attacks them. Daniela recovers when Judy plays Ed's recorded footage of the Bride's exorcism, and helps put the doll back in the case. After the case is locked, the disturbances cease as the spirits return to their slumber, and Bob reunites with the trio.

Ed and Lorraine return the next morning, and the girls approach them to recount the eventful night. Daniela apologizes to Lorraine, who gives her a comforting message from her father. Later, many friends gather to celebrate Judy's birthday party.</em></p>
                                                 <p><em><b>The Warren’s artefact room(Occult Museum)</b> is jam-packed full of nods to the real-life paranormal team’s investigations as well as the demons we’ve met in The Conjuring franchise.

The room has cropped up before, but now it becomes the central part of the story as Judy, her babysitter, and friend, all venture inside and unleash Annabelle and her demon friends in Annabelle Comes Home.

There are a few familiar items you will have spotted inside the room, like the Perron music box that appeared in The Conjuring films, the armour and the monkey playing the accordion. Warner Bros. released a 360 tour of the room that you can explore below.

The room itself is based on the real-life Occult Museum in Connecticut that holds the items Ed and Lorraine Warren collected when carrying out their investigations. The museum was open to the public, but due to zoning changes it’s been shut while the team running it find a new home.
